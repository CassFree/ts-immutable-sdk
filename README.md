# Immutable Core SDK

The Immutable Core SDK provides convenient access to the Immutable API's and Ethereum contract methods for applications written on the Immutable X platform.

## Documentation

- See the [developer guides](https://docs.x.immutable.com/docs) for information on building on Immutable X.
- See the [API reference documentation TODO update once new docs are live](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference) for more information on our API's.

## Installation

Install the package with:

```sh
npm install @imtbl/core-sdk --save
# or
yarn add @imtbl/core-sdk
```

## Usage

### Configuration

A configuration object is required to be passed into Core SDK requests. This can be obtained by using the `getConfig` function available within the Core SDK. You are required to select the Ethereum network. The Immutable X platform currently supports `ropsten` for testing and `mainnet` for production.

```ts
import { AlchemyProvider } from '@ethersproject/providers';
import { getConfig } from '@imtbl/core-sdk';

const ethNetwork = 'ropsten';

const config = getConfig(ethNetwork);

const privateKey = YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY;
const provider = new AlchemyProvider(ethNetwork, YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY);
const signer = new Wallet(privateKey).connect(provider);
```

### Standard API requests

The Core SDK includes classes that interact with the Immutable X APIs.

```ts
// standard API request example usage  
import { getConfig, AssetsApi } from "@imtbl/core-sdk";

const getYourAsset = await (tokenAddress: string, tokenId: string) => {
  const config = getConfig("ropsten");
  const assetsApi = new AssetsApi(config.api);

  const response = await assetsApi.getAsset({
    tokenAddress,
    tokenId,
  });

  return response;
};
```

[TODO - which API endpoints?]

#### Project authorisation

[TODO] add an example of how to use a workflow function

[TODO] list all workflow functions available

POST /projects

#### L1 signing

[TODO]

### Contract requests

[TODO] add description about how imx is built on starkex

[TODO] add example of a singular contract call

### Worklows

A workflow is a combination of API and contract calls required for more 
complicated functionality.

```ts
/**
 * User registration workflow example
 */
import { AlchemyProvider } from "@ethersproject/providers";
import { Wallet } from "@ethersproject/wallet";
import { getConfig, Workflows } from "@imtbl/core-sdk";

const alchemyApiKey = YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY;
const ethNetwork = "ropsten";

// setup provider and signer 
const provider = new AlchemyProvider(ethNetwork, alchemyApiKey);
const signer = new Wallet(privateKey).connect(provider);

// configure Core SDK Workflow class
const config = getConfig(ethNetwork);
const workflows = new Workflows(config);

const registerUser = async () => {
  const response = await workflows.registerOffchain(signer);
  console.log(response);
};
```

The workflow can be found in the [workflows directory](src/workflows/).

### Available Workflows

Workflow methods exposed from the `Workflow` class.

- batchNftTranser
- burn
- deposit
- depositERC20
- depositERC721
- depositEth
- getBurn
- isRegisteredOnchain
- mint
- registerOffchain
- transfer

## Autogenerated code

Parts of the Core SDK are automagiaclly generated.

### API autogenerated code

We use OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger) to auto-generate the API clients that connect to the public APIs.

[TODO - Ipek?]

### Smart contract autogeneration

[TODO - Allan?]
