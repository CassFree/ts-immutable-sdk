# Immutable Core SDK

The Immutable Core SDK provides convenient access to the Immutable API's and Ethereum contract methods for applications written on the Immutable X platform.

## Documentation

- See the [developer guides TODO update once new docs are live](https://docs.x.immutable.com/docs) for information on building on Immutable X.
- See the [API reference documentation TODO update once new docs are live](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference) for more information on our API's.

## Installation

Install the package with:

```sh
npm install @imtbl/core-sdk --save
# or
yarn add @imtbl/core-sdk
```

## Usage

### Configuration

A configuration object is required to be passed into Core SDK requets. This can be obtained by using the function `getConfig` available within the Core SDK. You are required to select the Ethereum network. The Immutable X platform currently supports `ropsten` for testing and `mainnet` for production.

```
import { getConfig } from "@imtbl/core-sdk";

const config = getConfig("ropsten")
```

### Standard API requests

```
import { getConfig, AssetsApi } from "@imtbl/core-sdk";

...

const config = getConfig("ropsten")
const assetsApi = new AssetsApi(config.api);

const response = await assetsApi.getAsset({
  tokenAddress: TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  tokenId: TOKEN_ID,
});
```
